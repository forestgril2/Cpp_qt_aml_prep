# C++/Qt/QML Technical Interview Preparation Plan

## Preparation Timeline
I have around 2h today and around 3h tomorrow for preparation. Ideally, we will try to cover most of the topics this German company could ask today and deepen the topics tomorrow.

## How to Use This Plan
- Each topic links to a separate file (to be filled with subtopics, questions, tasks, and notes).
- We will iteratively deepen each topic as time allows.
- Practice questions, code exercises, and reading material will be added later.
